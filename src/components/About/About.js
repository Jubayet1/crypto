            A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, crypto, or coin is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of 
            exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or 
            bank, to uphold or maintain it. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is 
            a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of 
            additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are 
            not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying treatments have been applied to 
            them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally 
            viewed as a distinct asset class in practice. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the 
            cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get 
            authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional 
            ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.
